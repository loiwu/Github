<br/>Delegation
<br/>Apple uses the delegation pattern

<br/>Protocols
<br/>For every object that can have a delegate, 
there is a corresponding protocol that declares the messages that the object can send its delegate.
<br/>The delegate implements methods from the protocol for events its is interested in.
<br/>When a class implements methods from a protocol, it is said to conform to the protocol.
